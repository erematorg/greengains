## Full Description (4000 characters max)

Turn your phone into a passive income generator. GreenGains rewards you for sharing anonymous environmental sensor data that helps build better weather forecasts, air quality models, and smart city infrastructure.

**How It Works**

Simply install the app, enable background tracking, and go about your day. Your phone's sensors (pressure, light, GPS, motion) collect anonymous environmental data that gets uploaded to our network. The more you contribute, the more you earn.

**Key Features**

• Passive Income - Earn credits automatically while your phone is in your pocket
• Daily Pot Rewards - Upload 5 batches of data per day to unlock bonus credits (10-100 per claim)
• Coverage Map - Watch your geographic coverage grow as you move around
• Privacy First - All data is anonymous and encrypted. No personal information collected.
• Battery Optimized - Intelligent background service adapts to your motion patterns
• Zero Effort - Set it and forget it. No manual actions required.

**What Gets Collected?**

We collect anonymous sensor readings from your device:
- Barometric pressure (for weather forecasting)
- Ambient light levels (for daylight analysis)
- GPS location (for geographic mapping)
- Motion patterns (to optimize battery usage)

Your data helps power:
- Hyper-local weather predictions
- Air quality monitoring networks
- Urban planning and smart city development
- Climate research and environmental studies

**Privacy & Security**

- No personal data collected (name, email, photos, contacts, etc.)
- Data is anonymous and cannot be traced back to you
- You control when tracking starts and stops
- Full transparency on what's collected
- GDPR compliant with easy data deletion
